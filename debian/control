Description: A disk imaging solution for creating partial, sparse, binary images of windows machines for forensic analysis. 
 NBD-SparseImager is a solution for imaging medium quantities of hard-disks for forensic analysis.
 The solution is intended to solve the folowing problems:
    * Disks get bigger all the time
    * Full imaging of several 1T disks becomes inpractical in terms of storage
    * Full imaging of several 1T disks becomes inpractical in terms of time
    * Depending on the type of investigation not all data is as relevant (e.g. content of dllâ€™s and executables in general are not that relevant)
